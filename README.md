# Mermaid From Prolog

## Introduction
As third practical work the proposal is to implement a prolog program to
take the specication of a class diagram and convert it into mermaid lan-
guage. The idea is to receive a valid specication (dened with prolog pred-
icates based on ClassDG) and generate a diagram of that specication built
in mermaid.
This work (individual or in group of two students) must be delivered till
17th May 2024 uploading a .pl le with comments.

## Define prolog predicates to:
- 1. insert the specication of a class, a list of attributes, a list of operations
and a set of relations between classes;
- 2. validate each relation specication verifying if the classes involved are
already dened;
- 3. count the number of attributes of a class;
- 4. generate mermaid code in order to visualize the graph representing
the class diagram.
